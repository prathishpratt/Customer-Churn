## Introduction and Background


### What is Customer Churn ?

 Customer churn is defined as the number of customers who have stopped doing business with a company during a given time period. Churn poses a problem for a business as it lowers revenues and profits. Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers, attracting a new customer costs five times as much as keeping an existing one. So To reduce customer churn, Companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
 
 ### Data 

The Telco customer churn data contains information about a telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index. _The original module contains five data tables, but only three will be considered for analysis: Demographics, Services, and Status_.

- Each row represents a customer.
- Each column contains customer’s attributes.

#### The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
